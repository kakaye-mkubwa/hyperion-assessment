# Task 2

**Project** :
 https://github.com/kakaye-mkubwa/MovieSearchEngine
 
 Despite having developed numerous programs in a number of technologies, I take pride in successfully
  completing this mini- search engine. It pushed me to learn more on `HashMaps` more so with regards 
  to development of a search engine and how some search engines work. Through it I got to learn 
  of Lucene, and since then I have been broadening my knowledge in this area.
